CWAC CustomMenu: Putting Users In Control
=========================================

**THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED &mdash; USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This framework allows you to have a option menu whose order
is customizable by end users. You can have fixed-position
items at the beginning or end, plus a configurable set of
menu choices in the middle. The menu will have a default
order for the items initially. If you launch into a supplied
`MenuCustomizer` activity, the user can change the order of
those menu choices, which you can then persist as you see
fit (e.g., JSON file in the local file storage).

Usage
-----
Full instructions for using this module are forthcoming. Stay
tuned!

Dependencies
------------
None at present.

Version
-------
This is version 0.1 of this module, meaning it is pretty darn
new.

Demo
----
In the `com.commonsware.cwac.custmenu.demo` package you will find
a sample activity that demonstrates the use of this framework.

Note that when you build the JAR via `ant jar`, the sample
activity is not included, nor any resources -- only the
compiled classes for the actual library are put into the JAR.
